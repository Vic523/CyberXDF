## About
CyberXDF is a shopping list application designed for college students who just start independent living. It serves as an efficient and educational tool for young students to become more engaged and informed about their grocery shopping plan. From selecting diet plans to filling nutrition bars, users go through every grocery trip with fun and learn to cultivate balanced diets bit by bit on their phones.

## Open-source notice
As of June 2nd, 2023, CyberXDF will transit to an open-source project. Any individual(s) who wish to further develop this application are welcome to take advantage of the current code from the shared repository. Meanwhile, later developers should be mindful to contact the original team member listed in the last section before continuing to work on the project, as formal decisions regarding the future development plan need to be determined through discussion. The original team reserves the right to know and authorize significant changes to CyberXDF.
Systems collecting user data and cloud services have been shut down. All collected user data will be deleted by June 2nd, 2023, and the code repository will be converted to public by the same date.
